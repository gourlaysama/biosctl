###Â Fixed

## [0.3.0] - 2021-03-22

### Added

* A `set` subcommand to set the value of a setting.
* The `info` subcommand now shows if a reboot is pending.


## [0.2.0] - 2021-03-17

### Added

* A `get` subcommand to get the value of a setting, with `-d/--default` and `-n/--name` to get the default value or display name instead.
* An `info` subcommand to display global information about the BIOS/EFI device.

### Changed

* Renamed from `firmconfig` to `biosctl`.
* Refactored to only use a single device at a time, with `dell-wmi-sysman` the default.
* Renamed the short option for `--device-name` from `-d` to `-D` and moved it to the top level.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-03-12

### Added

* A `list` subcommand to list all available attributes.
* A `print <ATTRIBUTE>` subcommand to print information about an attribute, or all of them if not specified.
* Both subcommands take a `-d/--device-name` to restrict the search to a single device, otherwise it picks the first attribute with the right name it finds.
